![latest commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/barmat80/RoundRobinGeneratorFX?color=blue)
![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/barmat80/RoundRobinGeneratorFX?color=green)

a JavaFX application that generates Round-Robin Tournament fixtures.

## How it works

* The generation logic is based on my previous project **[RoundRobinGenerator](https://github.com/barmat80/RoundRobinGenerator)**
* I tried to implement MVCI pattern by **[Dave Barrett](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/)**
* Themes are based on **[AtlantaFX](https://github.com/mkpaz/atlantafx)** by mkpaz.

## TODO List:

- [ ] Add a Theme Manager (currently if you want to switch a theme you have to edit theme.pref)
- [ ] Load a text formatted file as input
- [ ] Configurations: start date of the tournament
- [ ] Configurations: "play every X days"
- [ ] Configurations: time schedule of matchday
- [ ] Export generated Rounds as a text file
- [ ] Export Rounds as a pdf file

## Known Bugs

When you click one of the navigation buttons in Rounds Section for the first time, it shows twice the Matchday 1 card
